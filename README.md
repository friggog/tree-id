# tree-id
Code for the paper 'TODO'.

Achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art methods, though uses only shape features extracted from the curvature map of the leaf (no colour or texture features).

Scripts included to preprocess the images, extract features and train and evaluate classifiers.
Datasets are not included, though an example of the required structure is given.
